            <p>Gautama Buddha, popularly known as the Buddha (also known as Siddhattha Gotama or Siddhārtha Gautama[note
                3] or
                Shakyamuni), was an ascetic, a religious leader and teacher who lived in ancient India (c. 6th to 5th
                century BCE or c.
                5th to 4th century BCE).[6][7][8][note 4] He is regarded as the founder of the world religion of
                Buddhism, and revered
                by Buddhists as an enlightened being,[9] who rediscovered an ancient path to freedom from ignorance,
                craving and the
                cycle of rebirth and suffering. He taught for around 45 years and built a large following, both monastic
                and lay.[10]
                His teaching is based on his insight into the arising of suffering or dissatisfaction and its ending—the
                state called
                Nirvana (lit. vanishing or extinguishing).</p>

            <h1>Names and titles</h1>
            <img src="./images.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Besides "Buddha" and the name Siddhārtha Gautama (Pali: Siddhattha Gotama), he was also known by other
                names and titles,
                such as Shakyamuni ("Sage of the Shakyas").[19][note 5] The clan name of Gautama means "descendant of
                Gotama", and comes
                from the fact that Kshatriya clans adopted the names of their house priests.[20][21]

                In the early texts, the Buddha also often refers to himself as Tathāgata (Sanskrit: [tɐˈtʰaːɡɐtɐ]). The
                term is often
                thought to mean either "one who has thus gone" (tathā-gata) or "one who has thus come" (tathā-āgata),
                possibly referring
                to the transcendental nature of the Buddha's spiritual attainment.</p>

            <h1>Historical person</h1>
            <img src="./images1.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Scholars are hesitant to make unqualified claims about the historical facts of the Buddha's life. Most of
                them accept
                that the Buddha lived, taught, and founded a monastic order during the Mahajanapada era during the reign
                of Bimbisara
                (c.  558 – c. 491 BCE, or c. 400 BCE),[26][27][28] the ruler of the Magadha empire, and died during the
                early years of
                the reign of Ajatashatru, who was the successor of Bimbisara, thus making him a younger contemporary of
                Mahavira, the
                Jain tirthankara.[29][30] While the general sequence of "birth, maturity, renunciation, search,
                awakening and
                liberation, teaching, death" is widely accepted,[31] there is less consensus on the veracity of many
                details contained
                in traditional biographies.</p>
